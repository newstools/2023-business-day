The Constitutional Court has thrown out President Cyril Ramaphosa’s application to challenge parliament’s report, which found  the president may have broken anti-corruption laws. Ramaphosa applied for direct access to the apex court in reviewing the three-member section 89 panel report into the theft of cash at his farm in Phala Phala because of the serious nature of the recommendations contained in the report. He asked the court to declare the report unlawful and set it aside, particularly its finding that he may have been involved in impeachable conduct. The application by Ramaphosa was, however, dismissed by the Constitutional Court on Wednesday. “No case has been made for exclusive jurisdiction or direct access and the main application was dismissed,” the short judgment reads. “Consequently, the application to intervene falls to be dismissed.” In December, the National Assembly voted to reject the adoption of the impeachment inquiry  aimed at holding Ramaphosa accountable for allegedly concealing the theft of the funds at his game farm. This paved the way for Ramaphosa to be re-elected as the ANC’s president in December. maekot@businesslive.co.za
