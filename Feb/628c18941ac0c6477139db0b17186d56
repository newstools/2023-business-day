MTN Nigeria on Wednesday reported a 21.5% rise in annual service revenue, with data, fintech and digital services in particular firing on all cylinders. Data revenue jumped 47% as a result of growth in active data users and data usage after the company expanded its 4G network to cater to growing data traffic.

The number of fintech users rose 57.5% to 14.9-million, of which about  2-million represent are active on the MoMo mobile payments platform. Nigeria is Johannesburg-based telecom group’s biggest and most lucrative market. However, since the lion’s share of that country’s fiscal revenues come from sales of crude oil, MTN’s share price is sensitive to movements in international oil prices. The number of registered MoMo wallets since its launch in May 2022 was 13.2-million, MTN Nigeria said in a results statement for the year to end-December. Digital revenue grew 64% as the “adoption of our digital products continues to grow with user journey optimisation and the growth of the active base, up 37.5% to 10.3-million”, the company said. “Our rich media services, mobile advertising and content (value-added services)  continue to drive revenue growth. Our instant messaging platform, ayoba, accounted for half of our active users.” Voice revenue rose 6.8%, bucking the slower growth trend of general voice traffic as data usage continues to increase. Mobile subscribers rose 10.5% to 75.6-million while active data users gained 15.3% to 39.5-million. mahlangua@businesslive.co.za
