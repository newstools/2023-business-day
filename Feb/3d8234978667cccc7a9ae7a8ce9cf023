Harmony Gold Mining, the largest gold producer in SA by volume, said on Wednesday that it is on track to achieve its full-year production target, despite the power shortages afflicting many businesses in the country. Like other gold miners, Harmony Gold still relies heavily on Eskom for energy but is currently working on a pipeline of renewable and alternative energy projects as way of reducing operating costs and relieving some pressure from the national grid. Most of Harmonyâ€™s operations are in SA, with two of its mines in Papua New Guinea and one in Australia, though it is now looking to diversify into commodities such as copper as the local gold industry matures. In the production update on Wednesday, the gold miner said it was on course to achieve between 1.4-million and 1.50-million ounces of gold in the year to end-June at an all-in sustaining cost of less than R900,000/kg. Gold output for the six months to end-December was between 720,000oz and 745,000oz. In the same statement, Harmony said feasibility studies were under way following the conclusion of the Eva Copper transaction in December for about R4bn. Copper is expected to benefit from the so-called green transition. But the deal could also cushion Harmony Gold as gold mines in its home reach maturity and become more expensive to operate. mahlangua@businesslive.co.za
